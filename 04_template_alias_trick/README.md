# Example 04: Template Alias Trick

This example demonstrates using template specialization to create type-specific accessors for private members.

## Overview

The template alias trick uses explicit template specialization to create custom accessor logic for specific types. While more structured than pointer arithmetic, it still has significant limitations.

## Key Points

- **Type-Specific**: Uses template specialization for each type
- **Structured Approach**: More organized than raw pointer manipulation
- **Still Limited**: Requires a way to obtain private member pointers
- **Compile-Time**: Errors are caught at compile time
- **Verbose**: Requires template boilerplate for each class/member

## How It Works

1. Create a base template for accessing private members
2. Specialize the template for specific types
3. Define accessor logic in the specialization
4. The template provides a structured interface

## Limitations

1. Still needs the actual member pointer somehow
2. Often requires combining with other techniques
3. Verbose - needs specialization for each type
4. Doesn't solve the fundamental problem of private access
5. May require compiler-specific extensions for full functionality

## Building and Running

```bash
cd 04_template_alias_trick
g++ -std=c++17 example.cpp -o example
./example
```

## Notes

This technique provides better structure than raw pointer manipulation but doesn't fully solve the private access problem without additional techniques or compiler extensions. It's more of a framework for organizing access logic than a complete solution.
